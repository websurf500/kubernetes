HELM Client Installation
-------------------------

Step 1:

curl -fsSl -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3

This command silently downloads a script named "get_helm-3" from the Helm project on GitHub and saves it as "get_helm.sh" on your local machine.


Step 2:

chmod 700 get_helm.sh

Make the script executable by providing full permission to the owner of the file.


Step 3:

./get_helm.sh

Run the above script to install Helm 3 on your system


Try checking commands:
 
$ helm

$ helm repo ls
